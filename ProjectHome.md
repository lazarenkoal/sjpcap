Popular java-based packet capture (pcap) libraries implement parts of their functionality using libpcap over JNI. For those that require nothing more than support for parsing pcap files, these libraries introduce unnecessary complexity and potential OS compatibility issues.

The sjpcap library is a native alternative that parses libpcap-created packet capture files to create simplified, java-based object representations of IPv4-based IP, UDP and TCP packets.
